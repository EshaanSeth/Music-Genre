# Music Genre Classification 

Music Genre Classification with machine learning

Our goal was to develop a model that would take a music file (.mp3, .au) as input, and output its genre, among a set number of genres. We looked at Country, Classical, Metal, Pop, and often times we would only try to classify amongst subsets of these genres. We used different classification techniques, and we found that our algorithms could classify well when splitting music among up to ten genres.

The Objectives of this project are :

Build effective music genre classification models using a variety of machine learning techniques
Accurately classify genre of new music tracks with associated features
